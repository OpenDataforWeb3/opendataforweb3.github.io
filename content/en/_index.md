title : "OpenData Community"
description: "**What is the ODC?**
The OpenData Community is an open-source community originally founded by Gitcoin as a part of their efforts to enable communities to fund their shared needs.

Our mission is to protect web3, focusing on:

- Sybil resistance through data science and the development of useful algorithms and other approaches
- Resisting recentralization and potential capture at the data layer

If we collectively do not resist Sybil attacks then one of the real bright spots of web3 - the collective funding of public goods - could be captured by essentially criminal forces. Similarly, if we continue to all take shortcuts when accessing and analyzing blockchain data then we are adding vulnerability to the ecosystem right above the decentralized blockchains in the form of centralization."
