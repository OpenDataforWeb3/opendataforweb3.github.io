##  What is a Sybil Attack and why we should fight it?

A Sybil attack refers to a type of attack in which an attacker creates multiple fake identities, or "Sybils” to gain an unfair advantage within a decentralized network. This term is a reference to a [book entitled Sybil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_(Schreiber_book)). This book was also made into two television movies, the main character Sybil Dorsett endorsed different personalities.

In the context of systems/organizations, Sybil attacks happen when actions or rewards are calculated based on “one human, one identity”.
Fraudsters or 'Sybils' create multiple identities in an attempt to control (vote) or profit ( distributions of funds or rewards).
Fighting this kind of practice enables organizations to have democratic practices without the physical presence of its participants, for example, online voting in DAOs.

## What is quadratic funding and matching? Why is it important to understand Sybil attacks?  

Quadratic funding is a mechanism used by Gitcoin to fund public goods. Contributions to a grant are matched in a quadratic way by a matching fund.

Nice, now that you understood, is easy to get why fraudsters create multiple accounts. The idea is simple, make really small contributions to their own project from different accounts in an attempt to maximize ROI, as the quadratic funding algorithm prioritizes distribution of matching funds pool to projects that received donations from the biggest number of community members.

Similarly, the quadratic mechanism can also be applied to voting (quadratic voting) where each voter votes with some tokens, then fraudsters are incentivized to vote for a proposal from many addresses rather than a single address.


## What is the price of forgery? 

The price (or cost) of forgery, as it says, is the cost paid to forge an identity in a system. There are a lot of discussions about economic games involved in Sybil defense. Most systems are designed to develop a high cost of forgery in an attempt to disincentivize Sybil attacks, making the attack expensive and not profitable. Some discussions argue that this could stop Sybil attacks focused on profit but if the motivation is other, like ideological, the cost could be not a barrier.  

In ep 36 of Green Pill podcast, Kevin Owocki and Petr Porobov, founder of Upala, have some discussion around the topic and how Upala is trying to understand the real price of forgery using incentives.
