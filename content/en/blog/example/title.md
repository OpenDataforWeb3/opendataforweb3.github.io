Open source has grown in popularity over the years, with its prominence in the web3 space largely due to the efforts of Gitcoin and its web3 partners. While open source software has gained recognition for its transformative impact, the underlying issues it seeks to address remain prevalent in web3. To address these concerns, the Open Data Community (ODC) was established at the end of GR15 in late 2022. Its primary goal is to decentralize internet infrastructure by developing accessible protocols that utilize underutilized compute resources such as cloud data centers or personal computer towers.
