In ODC our mission is to protect web3, focusing on:

- **Sybil resistence** through data science and the development of useful algorithms and other approaches.
- **Resisting recentralization** and potential capture at the data layer.

If we collectively do not resist Sybil attacks then one of the real bright spots of web3 - the collective funding of public goods - could be captured by essentially criminal forces.  Similarly if we continue to all take short cuts when accessing and analyzing blockchain data then we are adding vulnerability to the ecosystem right above the decentralized blockchains in the form of centralization.
