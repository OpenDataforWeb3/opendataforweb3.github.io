### Finding fraud in public goods funding
 Leveraging data sets provided by Gitcoin and the ODC from the late April through early May public good funding round to be hosted by Gitcoin.

   - Sybil identification and defense
     - Use existing Legos & algorithms & dashboards to find potential Sybil attackers
     - Contribute new Legos, algorithms or dashboard improvements to find potential Sybil attackers.
     - The Sybil Identification Sandbox project hosted by the OpenData Community will be a foundation of this bounty.
   - Grant screening and review
     - Perform a screening of grant applicants, using existing algorithms, Legos, and dashboards.
     - Perform intra round analysis of potentially problematic grant applications, using existing algorithms, Legos and dashboards
     - Contribute new algorithms, Legos and Dashboards to Grant screening and review
     - The Grant Review Sandbox project hosted by the OpenData Community will be a foundation of this bounty.
   - Contributing to sustainability and modularity of the Sybil prevention and identification ecosystem via documentation and contribution to Gitcoin Passport:
     - Take existing Legos and list those that are not already documented in the docs as explained
      [here](https://github.com/Fraud-Detection-and-Defense/lego-docs#documenting-a-new-lego)
     - Find 1-2 useful Legos and integrate those into Gitcoin Passport, as explained
     [here](https://docs.passport.gitcoin.co/stamps/integrating-a-new-stamp)

### Web3 Tool Discovery (resisting data recentralization)

- In this set of contests, we will help contestants develop and demonstrate their expertise with a variety of useful solutions that further the decentralization of web3 at the data layer
- We are envisioning a quest format - where proof is provided at each step of the quest
   - Everyone that completes the quest will split one level of bounty
   - Top performers will be rewarded by an additional bounty, voted upon by the community
- Example quests include:
   - Demonstrating the integration of TrueBlocks with Pocket Network RPCs
   - Stand up a ETL pipeline using a pipeline [from] (https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl
   - Extend a pipeline to upload analysis and data sets on the Ocean Protocol marketplace

### Exposing DeFi and DAO fraud and manipulation

- Apply existing ODC and Gitcoin developed Legos - to other related use cases such as:
  - Wash trading:  Derive a score showing what percentage of trades in a given period on a given chain appear to be due to Sybil coordinated wash trades
  - Airdrop manipulation:  Examine the Arbitrum or other recent airdrops and suggest additional approaches that could have further assisted in finding and disqualifying Sybils or that could have reduced the incidence of false positives.
