## OpenData Community: useful projects
### What is the ODC?
The ODC is an open community dedicated to helping the web3 and crypto communities to use, analyze, and share data in an open way, as free as possible from centralized, proprietary, and non scalable approaches. As of early November 2022, our initial areas of focus are:
- Fighting Sybils
- Supporting the decentralization of data infra & tooling

This list is intended to be a growing list of projects that are open source that the community finds to be useful.  

Please contribute either by openning an issue or a PR vs this repository or some other way you prefer. You might also be interested in providing comments to a basic plan as well, which is available as a HackMD document [here](https://hackmd.io/@epowell101/rk7ZdHCZo)

### Project Categories

The categories below are simplistic and imperfect and will improve with input.

### Index transactions

Open source technologies used to Index transactions. 

**The Graph:**

- Github: [https://github.com/graphprotocol](https://github.com/graphprotocol)  

**TrueBlocks:**
- Website:  [https://trueblocks.io/](https://trueblocks.io/)
- Github: [https://github.com/trueblocks/trueblocks-core](https://)
- Unchained Index specification: https://trueblocks.io/papers/2022/file-format-spec-v0.40.0-beta.pdf
- Summary: *Lightweight indexing for any EVM-based blockchain.*

There are additionally a number of Index offerings that are sold as centralized and proprietary solutions.  

### Graph relationships 

**Raphtory:**

- Github:  [https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory](https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory)
- Summary: *Raphtory is a unified analytics engine for large-scale graph analysis, allowing you to run complex graph queries no matter where your data lives and what format it is in. Besides performance and scalability, what makes Raphtory cool is its ability to represent and explore the history of a complex system, from simply “time travelling” through data, to executing richer analysis like taint tracking, temporal reachability, or mining temporal motifs.*

- Summary:  *A developing privacy-centric data analytics protocol that leverages social graphs, data indexing, and off-chain/on-chain data porting to enable robust high-trust environments.*

### Interpret transactions

Technologies used to make sense of indexed transactions are many. They typically include approaches to simplify quering and in some cases these technologies include their own indexing.

**Transpose:**
- Website: https://www.transpose.io/
- Github: https://github.com/TransposeData  - only demos of API usage and similar
- Docs: docs.transpose.io
- Summary: *Provides SQL interfaces & a sandbox for analysis.*

**Kwil:**
